1. used tesseract-ocr, optical character recognition to convert inage to text.
2. used nodejs and installed tesseract-ocr.
3. The promises property in the fs module of Node.js is an additional feature that provides a way to work with files and folders in a more convenient and organized manner. It allows you to perform file operations (like reading, writing, deleting) using functions that return promises.
   Think of it this way: Imagine you're asking someone to do a task for you, but you don't want to wait for them to finish before moving on to other things. So instead, they give you a promise that they will complete the task and let you know when it's done. This way, you can continue with your other tasks and later check if the promised task has been completed.
   In the same way, when you use the fs.promises feature, you can ask the computer to perform file-related tasks (like reading or writing a file) and it will give you a promise that it will complete the task. You can continue with other parts of your code, and when the task is done, you can check the promise to see if it was successful or if an error occurred.
